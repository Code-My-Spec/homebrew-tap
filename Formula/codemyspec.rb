# Homebrew formula for CodeMySpec (macOS).
#
# Installs the plain `mix release` tarball — a self-contained OTP release (ERTS
# + start.boot on disk, no runtime extraction). `brew services` registers it
# with launchd, so there's no Shawl and no MSI on macOS.
#
# v1.5.40 / 1.5.40 / 7907082de0a63e9ea04af935e4ae310bc38dde3988fa7f8eee936d127b6d9c9c are templated by the
# release workflow (release-extension.yml) into the published copy.
